Version History (Latest on Top)

V0.0.1 - Statistics
  This is the first release with (somewhat) complete functionality.
  It needs some bug fixing and some exception handling but it's main purpose
  was only to throw together a quick UI for interecting with the basic
  statistics methods.
  
  Before moving on to working on the next version some things that need to
  be looked at improving:
  
  - Quartile and Percentile need dropdowns or at the very least some more labelling
  - Some adjusting the style of the form.
  - Clear the bug log
