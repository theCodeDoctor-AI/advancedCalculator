# advancedCalculator

So this is intended to be a fully functional GUI program,
and for now it is called an AdvancedCalculator.  I'm in the 
process of coming up with a better name;

Now this calculator, will not be able to do some things that
normal scientific calculators will not be able to do.  However,
they will be able to do many things that regular calculators
typically cannot do.

I'm also trying as much as possible to write custom methods for everything.
What I mean by that, is while the built in Math library contains methods
such as Pow, Sqrt, and such... I will try where possible to write my own
versions of these, and use as few built in methods as possible.

One exception is Linq.  Many of the Linq methods I feel would be difficult
for me to rewrite at this point, and I also wish to become more proficient in
general with Linq and so will be using the methods provided when applicable.

# Currently Implemented Features
 - A basic statistic library
 - Allows inputting / saving / reloading number sets
 - Saved number sets will still be available after restarting program

# In Progress for Next Major Update
 - Fractions (V0.1.0)
   - Will allow for entering in decimal numbers in fraction form and performing
     calculations
   - Can be accessed directly from main form
   - This is more of a placeholder feature for later reuse in the V1.0.0 release
 - Various bug fixes and quality of life upgrades 
 
# Future Planned Features:
 - Ability to build and make predictions with Linear Regression Models
 - Able to build, recoginize and make calculations on geometric 
   and arithmetic sequences
 - Ability to use multple different Cryptology techniques to encrypt
   and decrypt messages
 - Matrix Calculations (multiple matrix calculation features)
 - Much More..
