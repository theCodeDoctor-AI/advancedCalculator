# advancedCalculator

So this is intended to be a fully functional GUI program,
and for now it is called an AdvancedCalculator.  I'm in the 
process of coming up with a better name;

Now this calculator, will not be able to do some things that
normal scientific calculators will not be able to do.  However,
they will be able to do many things that regular calculators
typically cannot do.

Some features planned for the future are (but are not limited to):
 - A statistics library (limited funcitonality coming with version 0.0.1 --- Coming Soon!)
 - Ability to build and make predictions with Linear Regression Models
 - Able to build, recoginize and make calculations on geometric 
   and arithmetic sequences
 - Ability to use multple different Cryptology techniques to encrypt
   and decrypt messages
 - Matrix feature (multiple matrix calculation features)
 - Much More..
